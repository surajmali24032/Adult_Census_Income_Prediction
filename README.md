### Adult Census Income Prediction
The Adult Census Income Prediction project is a machine learning project that predicts an individual's income level based on their demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict an individual's income level, i.e., whether they make less than or equal to $50,000 per year or more than $50,000 per year.

## Dataset
The project uses the Adult Census Income dataset, which contains demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of individuals, including age, education, occupation, marital status, and more. The dataset can be obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository or Kaggle.

## Solution
The proposed solution involves building a binary classification algorithm to predict an individual's income level. The solution includes the following steps:

1. Data preprocessing
2. Feature engineering
3. Model selection
4. Model training
5. Model evaluation
6. Model deployment
7. CI/CD pipelines
8. Requirements

## The project requires the following dependencies:
1. Python 3.x
2. Scikit-learn
3. Pandas
4. NumPy
5. Seaborn
6. Flask

## Usage
To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the app.py file to preprocess the data, engineer features, select the best model train the model, and evaluate the model on the test set.
5. Deploy the model in a production environment.
